            <p>
                As a Legislator, your Account has two metrics: constituents and followers.
                <br>
                All your constituents automatically follow your Account, but are registered as constituents and not
                followers.
                <br>
                Your followers are non-constituents who choose to follow your Account.

            <p>
                Your Account may be followed by other accounts, but being a Legislator Account is not designed to follow
                other accounts.

            <p>
                To help our users differentiate, Town Hall posts are classified as either News or Opinion.
                <br>
                Being a Legislator Account, all posts from your Account are tagged as News posts.
